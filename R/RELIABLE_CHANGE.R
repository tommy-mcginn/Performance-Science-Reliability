#' @title Reliable Change Index (RCI) for a set of athlete measurements
#'
#' @description For each metric passed to the function, vectors indicating the lower and upper bounds of the RCI of that metric are
#'   generated, with the length of each vector equaling the number of athletes passed to the function
#'
#' @param subject The subjects on which the RCI test should be run
#' @param ... Numeric vectors that represent the metrics for which the RCI should be computed. These vectors hold the
#'   scores that each athlete recorded for each respective metric (at least one metric must be passed to the function).
#' @param baseline The measurements to be considered the "baseline" results for the calculation of the RCI
#' @param reliability A vector of the measures of reliability (i.e. the ICC's) for each of the metrics included in the "..."
#'   argument. It is suggested that the reliability measure chosen be the ICC, but it can be any reliability measure, as long as the
#'   measure chosen lies on a 0-1 scale (with 1 indicating higher reliability). This vector must contain the same number of
#'   elements as the number of metrics that have been passed to the function in the "..." argument, and the reliability values must
#'   appear in the same order as the metrics appear in the "..." argument.
#' @param confidence The degree of confidence the user wants to have that the lower and upper bounds given can be
#'   interpreted as real change, and not the result of random or measurement error. Set to a default value of 0.95, this
#'   parameter is used to calculate the corresponding critical value from the standard normal distribution that is used to compute
#'   the lower and upper bounds of the RCI.
#'
#' @return A table for each metric, with each row being an athlete and two columns, one for the RCI lower bound and the other for
#'   the RCI upper bound.
