The goal of psr is to help practitioners in the field of sports science,
whether it be coaches, athletic trainers, analysts, or even athletes
themselves, to efficiently and effectively analyze data from strength
and agility tests. This package includes seven functions that achieve
the purposes of measuring the reliability of the measurement instruments
involved in testing the athletes, setting benchmarks for each athlete in
their future tests, and standardizing the scores of the athletes across
metrics.
